Terra is a beginner-friendly interactive planting pot designed that is available for people of all ages!

Terra improves the experience of taking care of a plant and allows user to experience what it is like to own a pet.
Inspired by Tomogachi, it responds to its users through various different variables from the environment around it. More specifically, Terra uses a microcontroller, temperature sensor and a moisture sensor that takes the data obtained from the sensors to determine how the plant feels and then presents it to the user through an LCD screen. For example, if the plant has too much moisture within the soil, Terra will notify its user and give a corresponding feeling with the notification.
